#
#	STC_VERSION - Required
#	
# 	The test suite or tool version.  The version number supports a
# 	major and minor value:

#               Normally this indicates substantive changes and/or
#               additions in test suite or tool functionality.
#       minor = test suite or tool minor version. This should be incremented
#               if minor changes or additions are made (e.g. bug fixes)
#               The minor version should change every time the suite or tool
#               changes.  When the major number changes the minor number
