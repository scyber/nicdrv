Corrupt.auto
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description of test:
        Corrupt.auto is a test to check for corruption across nfs mounts
    and therefore the network connection.  To perform this Corrupt.auto
    makes export directories on each client interface and server interface.
    These exports are mounted on the matching server/client interface.
    The direction of the mounts is controlled by the TRAFFIC_TYPE flag in 
    the config file. The mount protocol is controlled by the PROTO flag
    in the config file.  The SESSIONS flag will set how many mounts are
    created on each interface.  Once the exports and mounts are setup 
    a instance of the testcorrupt binary is started on each mount.  The
    testcorrupt binary writes files across the nfs mount and calculates
    a checksum for the file data.  Once the file is wrote it is read back
    and the checksum is recalculated.  If the checksum is different then
    corruption has happened and reported to the log file.  The testcorrupt
    binary uses patterns from 0x00 to 0xff and increments the pattern
    by 0x01 for each file wrote.  The file size also starts out at a random
    number between 1 and 1000 and increases at a increasing rate to 120Mb.
    Once the upper limit is reached, the file size is cut in half and allowed
    to climb again.  The maximum load is when the file sizes are greater than
    60mb but the lower numbers are to verify corruption at sizes smaller 
    than the MTU and page size.  This load ramp is why it is advised to 
    run this script at least a hour.  Upon completion of the test results
    are mailed out and a log is put into /var/tmp/Corrupt.
